Project Overview

This project analyzes e-commerce user behavior to understand how customers navigate, engage, and convert across the funnel. The goal was to translate raw event-level data into clear insights around traffic quality, funnel drop-offs, and experiment performance, and to communicate those findings through an interactive dashboard and executive-ready presentation.

Key Questions Addressed:

How do users progress through the e-commerce funnel?
Which traffic sources drive higher-quality conversions?
Where does the largest drop-off occur in the customer journey?
Do experiment variants meaningfully impact engagement and conversion?
How should insights from behavior data inform optimization decisions?
