🛒 E-Commerce Customer Segmentation Dashboard

This project analyzes user activity across an e-commerce platform to understand how different customer groups behave and convert. Using event-level tracking data, the dashboard highlights engagement patterns, session behavior, conversion trends, and experiment-group performance. I cleaned the raw data, modeled it in SQL, and built an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize key behaviors and answer critical business questions.

🗂️ Dataset Used

events.csv – 100k+ e-commerce tracking events, including:

User actions (view, click, add_to_cart, purchase)

Experiment group assignments

Session IDs and event timestamps

Customer IDs and total interactions

Conversion-related behavior

📌 Project Summary

This dashboard explores e-commerce behavior by analyzing:

👥 Customer distribution across experiment groups

🔄 Session activity and total event volume

📈 Engagement rate based on meaningful actions

🛒 Conversion rate by experiment group

📊 Behavioral comparisons between customer cohorts

Each visual is designed to show where users drop off, which actions lead to conversions, and how experiment groups differ in performance.

🛠️ Tools & Skills Used

Excel → Initial cleanup, formatting, and CSV inspection
